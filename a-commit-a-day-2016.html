            <h1>New Years Resolution: A Commit a Day - 2016</h1>

            <p>
                One of my New Years Resolutions (apart from making more mod videos and working out/eating healthier) is to at least commit to one of my projects at least once a day. I am planning to spend at least 30 minutes per day for each of these commits. A "commit" can be something pretty simple - for example perhaps some <a href="">Bootstrap templates</a> I'm working on. In the future I might start just commiting some markdown files on programming practices. Another idea is to make guides for various interests of mine like modding Fallout 4, Skyrim, or a guide to using Photoshop.
            </p>

            <p>
                Mainly I am doing this because it would be cool to see the progress in a various projects over the year and to sharpen my programming skills. Most programmers know that continous learning and improvement is just something that comes with our career path.
            </p>
