            <h1>New Years Resolution: A Commit a Day in 2016</h1>

            <p>
                One of my New Years Resolutions (apart from making more mod videos and working out/eating healthier) is to commit to one of my projects at least once a day. I am planning to spend at least 30 minutes per day for each of these commits. A "commit" can be something pretty simple - for example perhaps by polishing up some <a href="https://github.com/insane0hflex/BootstrapThemesAndTemplates">Bootstrap templates</a> I'm working on or working on other projects/ideas. In the future I might start just commiting some markdown guides for various interests of mine like modding Fallout 4, Skyrim, creating mods, blog posts, and more.
            </p>

            <p>
                One of the main reasons behind the "Commit a Day" idea is that it would be interesting to see the progress in my projects over the year. Also, this resolution will aid me in trying to discipline myself to learning new programming skills. Most programmers know that continous learning and improvement is just something that comes with our career path. Hopefully I don't burn out.
