            <p>
                A bit of fatigue is setting in. Each line of code I write or new project I make is yet another line of code or project that I have to maintain.</p>
            </p>
            <p>
                For now, thinking of cleaning up some projects like the TES Name generator, which is a few years old. Also thinking of wrapping up SpartanCSS.

                Next projects are to make some Fallout 4 modding tutorials and host them here perhaps since they will be script-based mods I think. That or start on my 2D Dark Souls like game idea! Another project I am thinking of working on is making a ASP.NET 5 MVC 6 wiki like bootstrap/foundation, for like games (maybe next Elder Scrolls?) and such. Or a dedicated "Elder Scrolls Real Estate" site.
