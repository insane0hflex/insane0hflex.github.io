Better Living through Keybinds

I like to think of learning the keyboard shortcuts in programs you use as like learning keybinding shortcuts in games (especially PvP oriented ones like WoW or League of Legends). In a programming sense, learning the common keybinds for your text editor or IDE (Visual Studio for example) saves precious time.

Here are a few useful Keyboard Shortcuts for Visual Studio 2013 and newer. You can also check out the MSDN full guide here:
